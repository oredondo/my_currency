# MyCurrency - Python Backend Test

## Introduction
MyCurrency is a web platform designed to calculate currency exchange rates. It integrates with external providers, such as [CurrencyBeacon](https://currencybeacon.com/), to retrieve and store daily currency exchange rates. The platform is built to be flexible, allowing seamless integration with multiple currency data providers, each with potentially different APIs. 

You can create a free account at [CurrencyBeacon](https://currencybeacon.com/register). API documentation is available at [CurrencyBeacon API Docs](https://currencybeacon.com/api-documentation).

Supported currencies: **EUR, CHF, USD, GBP**.
